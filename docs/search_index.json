We can’t observe both students in a GT school and not in a GT school. Two potential outcomes: ELA and Math scores in or not in a school with GT option. \\(Y_0i\\) is the potential outcome (test scores) for school i without the treatment. \\(Y_1i\\) is the potential outcome (test scores) for school i with the treatment. The individual school treatment effect: \\(Y_1i - Y_0i\\) Due to the fundamental problem of causal inference, we can only observe one of the potential outcomes. So instead of estimating the individual school treatment effect, we estiamte the ATE (Average Treatment Effect), which is given by \\[ATE = E[Y_1-Y_0]\\] 3.0.2 Ignorability 3.0.2.1 Assignment Mechanism Ignorability: all variables affecting both Treatment and Outcome are obserbed and controlled for. And that the potential outcomes are independnet of treatment once we control for these features. So, treatment has no other effect on the potential outcome through some backchalnngel. Positivity: every obserbation has a positibe chance of being in the treatment or control group.
